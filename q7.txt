T1: R(X) W(X)           R(Y)                W(Y)
T2:           R(Y)           R(X) W(Y)           W(X)
T3:                R(X)                R(Y)           W(X) W(Y)


a. Conflict serializability


conflict on Y between T1 and T2: T1 --> T2
conflict on Y between T1 and T3: T3 --> T1
conflict on Y between T2 and T3: T2 --> T3

This graph has a cycle T1 --> T2 --> T3 --> T1
so the schedule is not conflict serializable


b.  View serializability

S1 ...
X first reader T1, last writer T3
Y first reader T2, last writer T3

There are two options because the T3 should be written last.
The first is that T1 begins before T2, but R(Y) is in T1 which read before than T2,so that is not feasible
The second is that T2 begins before T1, but R(X) appears in T2 which read before than T2,so that is also not feasible.

Therefore, there is no view equivalence.
